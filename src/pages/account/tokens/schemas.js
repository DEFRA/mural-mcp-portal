 * The generate-a-token form.

 * `label` is what upstream stores as the token's name. It is required here
 * even though `mural-mcp` would accept any non-empty string, because the label
 * is the only thing distinguishing one row of the listing from another - the
 * secret is gone and the prefix is eight random characters.
 *
 * `ttlDays` is constrained to `tokenExpiryValues` rather than a numeric range.
 * The form offers radios, so any other value is a hand-crafted request, and
 * upstream would silently clamp an out-of-range number to 365 days rather than
 * refuse it - a token quietly lasting longer than asked for is worth rejecting
 * outright.

/**
 * The revoke confirmation form.
 *
 * `label` carries the token's name across the redirect purely so the listing's
 * banner can say which token went. It is optional and bounded rather than
 * trusted: it is echoed back to its own author in their own session, but a
 * hidden field is still user input and has no business being unbounded on its
 * way into the session store.
 *
 * `truncate()` rather than a rejection, which is why this route needs no
 * `failAction`: the schema cannot fail. Refusing to revoke a token because its
 * display name was too long would be the worst imaginable moment to be fussy,
 * and the name is only ever used to write one sentence back to the person who
 * submitted it.
